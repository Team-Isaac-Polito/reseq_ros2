# This file is used as a config for bridging topics between ros2 and gazebo
# Topics and messages between ros2 and gazebo are different and in order for
# two frameworks to communicate we need to specify the conversion which is 
# called "bridge".
# More on this on https://docs.teamisaac.it/doc/gazebo-ros2-interoperability-2zADEb1xwk
